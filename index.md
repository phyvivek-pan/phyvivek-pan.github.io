PROJECT TITLE: MEASUREMENT OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS OF PAPER SHEET USING ELECTRONIC SPECKLE PATTERN INTERFEROMETER‚Äù

I have reported method to study surface roughness of silver nanoparticles treated handmade paper sheets using temporal five step phase shifting electronic speckle pattern interferometer (ESPI). Basically handmade paper sheets of silver nanoparticles show antimicrobial properties. Silver nano-particle impregnated paper exhibit different surface roughness than without it. To probe this further, we have used Electronic speckle pattern interferometer technique for evaluating surface roughness of some silver nano-particle with impregnated and without impregnated paper sheets
